You were always ruined, Tim. So ruined that even saying that increases the cringe.
Y'all know Bobby Broccoli is an engineering student?
Yeah
He might have said that in one of his videos
I vaguely remember him saying he was
He's graduating in like 2018 though
That's still close
Ok
What about it though
He mentioned it in his lp
Idk he's chill
Woop
Ye
He commented on my first tweet

@JamesBond http://store.steampowered.com/app/9480/ its free only for today
sweet
what's the difference between @ here and @ everyone
@ everyone notifies everyone through everything. @ here is the same, but there is no notif sound and can only be seen when discord is open.
so its much "softer" in a way
Here only @ the people,online @ tells everyone
Yea that
so, if it isn't an urgent message, @ here is better
Yea
ok thanks
I turn off notifications for everything but mentions anyways, so gg
Yo aren't you guys at school or something?

I should make a room entirely walled with sound foam.
